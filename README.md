# Retina (Highres) Spriting with Compass and SCSS

Dependancies: Ruby, [Compass](http://compass-style.org/install/).

Run `compass watch` within `/css/` to generate the SCSS.

The guts of it (plus some instructional comments) can be found in `/css/sass/main.scss`.

Note this demo is set up in such a way as to be clearer to understand, it is not a recommendation about how to lay out you own project.
